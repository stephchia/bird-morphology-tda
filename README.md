# Topological data analysis on the evolution of bird morphology

- This repository contains code and data for the analysis of the project: **_The Birds That Donâ€™t Exist: Tracing the evolutionary constraints on bird morphology_**
- This project explores the morphological trait space of the superfamily Passeroidea using topological data analysis (specifically **persistent homology**).
- The analysis identifies gaps in the morphospace, representing morphologies that don't exist within the group, and investigates the ecological and evolutionary processes that may constrain the development of these missing morphologies.

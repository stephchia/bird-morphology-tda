# Topological data analysis on the evolution of bird morphology

- This analysis is part of the project: **_The Birds That Donâ€™t Exist: Tracing the evolutionary constraints on bird morphology_**
- It contains code and data processing scripts for a study exploring the morphological trait space of birds using **persistent homology**, a tool from topological data analysis (TDA). The analysis focuses on identifying unoccupied regions (gaps) in morphospace within the superfamily **Passeroidea**, and investigates the ecological and evolutionary processes that may constrain the development of certain morphologies.
